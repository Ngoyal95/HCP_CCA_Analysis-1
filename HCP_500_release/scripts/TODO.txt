TODO:

1. repeat the CCA analysis using the HPC_500 data, try to replicate identically the result from Smith et al
2. Clean up the cca code, rewrite if necessary, understand all steps
3. run the CCA code on HPC_1200 data, see if the results hold up compared to HPC_500 (and 800?)
4. create cca analysis code that is more flexible, carefully document the SM removal and why
5. extend analysis to BioBank? CMI? ABCD? MEG?
